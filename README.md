# D683 – Advanced AI & Machine Learning | Portfolio Project

This repository contains an advanced AI/ML project focused on building, evaluating, and improving machine learning workflows using modern techniques and best practices. It is published as a **portfolio version** of an academic project completed as part of the Computer Science program at Western Governors University.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- End-to-end machine learning workflow implementation
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Performance comparison across approaches
- Reproducible experimentation and dependency management
- Clear documentation and professional version control practices

## Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy / Pandas
- scikit-learn (and other ML libraries as applicable)
- Jupyter / Script-based experiments
- Git / GitHub

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment recommended

### Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
